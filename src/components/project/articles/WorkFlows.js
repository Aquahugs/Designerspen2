                                Weâ€™re slowly starting to realize now that the design process is a common language between most creative fields. 
                                Creating a common language between the presently disparate fields of Architecture, Industrial Design, Video games, or Animation 
                                for example, suggests that the industries themselves may begin to hybridize and learn from one another.

                            A 3d model is way more versatile than a sketch on paper. Blender is a free and open 
                            source 3D creation suite. It can be used for a ton of different task like modeling, rigging, animation, simulation,
                             rendering, compositing and motion tracking.  It has a polygonal based modeling tool which is an approach for
                              modeling objects by representing or approximating their surfaces using polygons. <br/>
                              
                              After a while your brain will then be able to interpret your sketches at a thumbnail stage into a quick 3D models and blender is a great tool for such thing.

                             Cinema 4D and Octane render engine are two tools that work very well together for quickly being able to visualize
                             your 3d creations at very high quality. As of now Keyshot is probably the most popular render engine for industrial design. However
                             Octane is a GPU based renderer and  It gives you a good selection of options to tweak and refine your model rendering . 
                             Cinema 4d  and Octane have tons of resources online to learn for free but if both of these programs are acquired legitimately they carry hefty price tags.
